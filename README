STLENCODERS - Generic Base 16/32/64 encoding algorithms for C++
---------------------------------------------------------------

STLENCODERS is a C++ implementation of the standard Base 64 encoding
and decoding algorithms as defined in RFC 4648, working with STL
iterators.

STLENCODERS was mainly inspired by Nick Galbreath's excellent
STRINGENCODERS library.  But where stringencoders strives for maximum
performance while retaining a high grade of portability, stlencoders'
main goals are flexibility and ease of use in a modern C++
environment, even if sacrificing performance (a little).  However, as
the STRINGENCODERS project page puts it,

    Unless your application is doing almost nothing except encoding
    and decoding, the odds are that these functions will not improve
    the total performance of your application. Even with slow versions
    of base64 it's already so fast it's probably not measurable in
    your application.

As always, your mileage may vary.
